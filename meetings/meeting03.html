<summary>Club Contract</summary>
<p>Your <em>Girls Who Code</em> club is a sisterhood that helps prepare you to change the world. Part of creating this bond is discussing and agreeing upon the commitments you'll make to your sisters and how you'll support each other. Some important questions to ask yourself are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What does sisterhood mean to you?</li>
		<li>What expectations and rules do you think we should have?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The initial contract:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><h3>Work hard.</h3></li>
		<li><h3>Be brave.</h3> Try something new, and speak up if you don't understand.</li>
		<li><h3>Be curious.</h3> Ask questions, and experiment.</li>
		<li><h3>Be kind.</h3> Try to make a new friend! Ask a neighbor for help before asking a teacher, and show patience if someone is stuck.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>What can we add?</p>
