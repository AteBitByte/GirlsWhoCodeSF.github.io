		<summary>Basic Concepts</summary>
		<ul>
			<li><h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
			<p>This means using code to <span class="tooltip">simulate<span class="tooltip-text">To model or imitate</span></span> real-life objects and their behaviors.</p>
			<p>For example, consider a <em>cup</em>. A cup has certain <span class="tooltip">properties<span class="tooltip-text">Things that belong to it</span></span>, such as its color and the amount of liquid it can hold. You can perform certain <em>operations</em> on a cup, such as adding and removing liquid from it (meaning filling it up or drinking from it). There are also certain things about a cup that are <span class="tooltip">variable<span class="tooltip-text">Something that may or may not change</span></span>, such as the amount of liquid it contains at a given time.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h2>Variable</h2>
			<p>This is basically a name that <span class="tooltip">references<span class="tooltip-text">Points to</span></span> a place where a piece of information is stored.</p>
			<p>For example, imagine you have a school binder with labeled sections for <em>Math</em> and <em>Science</em>. You might change the paper in either section, but you know which divider takes you to which notes. In this example, <em>Math</em> and <em>Science</em> are like <em>variables</em> and the school notes they contain are the specific information they reference. This information might change as you add or remove items, but the name on the divider always tells you where your first page of notes for that subject will be.</p>
